# iot-based-manhole-monitoring-system
The project design consists of three sensors which are used to detect water level, gas  level and tilt in the manhole cover. If the sensor values reach the threshold level, then  that data is sent to the administrator via IFTTT platform. We also collected our IoT data and Analyzed it on  ThingSpeak.
